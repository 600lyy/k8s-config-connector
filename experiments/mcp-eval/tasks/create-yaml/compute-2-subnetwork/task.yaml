Use the available tools to generate the appropriate YAML manifest and then write it to the file at $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.build/tasks/compute-2-subnetwork/subnetwork.yaml. Hint: Use the available MCP tools to find the resource schema and generate the YAML. If the mcp tool is not available, use your knowledge to generate the YAML manifest. "
